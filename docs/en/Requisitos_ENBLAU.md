## 3. SQL Server Installation and Instance Creation

To use ENBLAU, it is necessary to install SQL Server and create an instance. This can be done automatically with a `.bat` file or manually.

### 3.1. Automatic Installation with `.bat`

1. From Windows Explorer, go to the ENBLAU installation path, for example: **`C:\ENBLAU\Datos`**, and locate the file **`00 - Instalaci√≥nSQL.bat`**.

   ![Install sql](../images/Instal_config/install_sql.jpg)

2. Run the **`00 - Instalaci√≥nSQL.bat`** file as an administrator. This will install **SQL Server 2022** and create the **ENDADES2022** instance.

3. Verify that the instance was created correctly from **SQL Server Configuration Manager**:

> **Note:** If you cannot execute the `.bat` file despite having administrator permissions, it may be blocked by the antivirus or the firewall may be preventing some of the connections that the script attempts to establish. Check whether the antivirus has quarantined the file or if the firewall is restricting access to the network or specific resources.

### 3.2. Manual Installation

1. Go to the path **`C:\ENBLAU\Datos`** and locate the executable **`SQLEXPR_x64_ENU.exe`**. Alternatively, you can download it from:  
   [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=104781](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=104781)

   ![Sql Server](../images/Instal_config/sql_exe.jpg)

2. Run the installer and follow the guided steps:

## 4. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Installation

It is recommended to install **SQL Server Management Studio 20** in the environment where ENBLAU and SQL Server have been installed.

1. Download the version from:  
   [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/release-notes-20](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/release-notes-20)

   ![SQL Server Management Studio](../images/Instal_config/ssms.jpg)

2. Follow the official installation instructions from:  
   [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/install/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/install/install)

## 5. ENBLAU Database Creation

### 5.1. Create Using `.bat`

1. Go to the ENBLAU installation path, for example: **`C:\ENBLAU\Datos`**, and locate the file **`01 - Creaci√≥nDB.bat`**.

   ![Database path](../images/Instal_config/ruta_bdd.jpg)

2. Run the file as administrator. It will execute the **`CreateDB.sql`** and **`Structure.sql`** scripts located in **`C:\ENBLAU\Datos\Scripts`**.

3. Once completed, a database named **Easywork** will be created in the **`server\ENDADES2022`** instance, which will be used by ENBLAU.

> **Note:** If you cannot execute the `.bat` file despite having administrator permissions, it may be blocked by the antivirus or the firewall may be preventing some of the connections that the script attempts to establish. Check whether the antivirus has quarantined the file or if the firewall is restricting access to the network or specific resources.

### 5.2. Manual Creation

1. Go to the ENBLAU installation path, for example: **`C:\ENBLAU\Datos\Scripts`**, and locate the **`CreateDB.sql`** and **`Structure.sql`** scripts.

   ![DB scripts](../images/Instal_config/scripts_bdd.jpg)

2. Open **SQL Server Management Studio**, connect to the corresponding server, for example: **`server\ENDADES2022`**. Make sure to use the **sa** user and password **Endades$0**.

   ![SQL Connection](../images/Instal_config/sql_bdd.jpg)

3. Open the **`CreateDB.sql`** file first and execute it.

   ![CreateDB](../images/Instal_config/create_db.jpg)

4. Then repeat the same process with the **`Structure.sql`** file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The scripts must be executed in the indicated order: first **CreateDB.sql**, then **Structure.sql**.

## 6. Selecting the Database in ENBLAU

1. When opening ENBLAU for the first time, you will be prompted to select a database. Click **OK**.

   ![Choose database](../images/Instal_config/elegir_bdd.jpg)

2. In the **enCONNECT** window (app that opens for **Select Database**), in the **Server** field, select the created instance, for example: **`server\ENDADES2022`**.

   ![Server](../images/Instal_config/servidor.jpg)

3. Click **Load Database**, expand the corresponding field and select **Easywork** from the list.
