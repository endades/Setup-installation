## 1. Errors and Solutions

### 1.1. Server and Database Connection Error

**Error Description:**  
  When trying to select the database in **ENBLAU**, an error message appears if the server or instance cannot be found.  
  This issue may be caused by blocks from the **antivirus** or **firewall** on the server where ENBLAU is running.

**Solution:**  
  Review the antivirus or firewall rules and exceptions on the server. Example:

  1. From Firewall → Advanced Settings → **Inbound Rules**, verify that ports **1433 TCP** (standard SQL Server port) and **1434 UDP** (for instance discovery) are enabled:

**Solution:**

  1. **Check the network:**  
    Make sure the tablet is connected to the **same local network** as the server hosting the database.

  2. **Check the firewall and antivirus:**  
    Ensure the **firewall** and/or **antivirus** are not blocking the connection between the device and SQL Server.  
    Add rules or exceptions if necessary.

  3. **Check port configuration:**  
    On the server, make sure the **SQL Server ports are enabled**, including:
    - **1433/TCP** (standard SQL Server port). Verify and configure in **SQL Server Configuration Manager**:  
        - Go to **SQL Server Network Configuration → Protocols for ENDADES2022**.  
        - In **TCP/IP Properties → IP Addresses**, ensure that <span style="color:red">**all IPs**</span> have the **TCP Port** set to **1433** and the **TCP Dynamic Port** set to **0**.

          ![enSITE error](../images/Erros/error_ensite3.jpg)

      - **1434 UDP** (for instance discovery)
      <!-- - Other custom ports that may be used by enSITE, for example: **TCP-57073** -->

---

**Note:** This error is common when there are network or security configuration conflicts. Checking all the points above usually resolves the issue.

---

> ⚠️ **Important:** It is mandatory to use at least **SQL Server 2022** to ensure compatibility with ENBLAU and enSITE versions.
